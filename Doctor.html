				<h1>10 Responsible Pet Care Tips</h1>
					<ol>
						<li> 
							<h2>Veterinarian Visits</h2>
							<p>Responsible pet ownership starts with regular visits to the veterinarian. Given their shorter-than-human lifespan, your
							dog or cat should be getting a checkup at least once or twice a year. Depending on your pet's vaccination schedule, they
							may go more frequently when they're young, but establishing and maintaining good pet health means keeping up with vet
							visits as they age.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h2>Vaccinations</h2>
							<p>Vaccinating your pets is a vital component of responsible pet care. Soon after welcoming your new pet into your home,
							schedule an immunization appointment. During your first visit, the vet will set up an immunization schedule for your
							little pup or kitten to protect them from illness and disease. Vaccinations for puppies should happen early in your
							puppies first few weeks after you bring him home.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Proper Identification</h2>
							<p>If the unthinkable happens and your little guy or gal gets lost — youngsters in particular are prone to dashing out the
							door — having proper identification is the key to a happy ending.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Spaying/Neutering	</h2>
							<p>Sterilizing your pet prevents a host of health problems, including complicated pregnancies, and reduces the number of
							homeless animals.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Healthy Food</h2>
							<p>Two connected elements of responsible pet ownership include providing animals with fresh, cool water and healthy food at
							all times. The right pet food will enrich your best buddy's life, providing them with the energy and nutrients they
							need. With so many meal options to choose from, it can be daunting, but you can become adept in no time by familiarizing
							yourself with important ingredients and how they help your pup or kitty.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>At-Home Care</h2>
							<p>As your pets' caretaker, your job is to provide them with good hygiene habits at home as well as at the vet's or
							groomer's. Brushing their teeth, combing their coats and providing them with healthy food all keeps them in tip-top
							shape. To stay on track with responsible pet care, schedule hygiene and grooming tasks in your calendar and try
							combining tasks, such as a comforting comb after trimming nails, until it becomes routine.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Comfy Quarters</h2>
							<p>
							As the seasons change or you rearrange your living space, take a look around to see that you're providing your pet with
							a safe, cozy habitat. Dog bed looking a little flat? Buy your pup a new one. Litter box area not cutting it anymore?
							Spruce up your kitty's bathroom with a new box and scoop. This also is a good time to check for potential hazards. Look
							for exposed cords or wires (young animals find these to be great chew toys), secure safety gates, repair loose windows
							or screens and remove any plants that are poisonous to your pet.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Training and Socializing</h2>
							<p>
								One of the most important aspects of responsible pet care is ensuring your dog or cat is well-trained, and proper
								socializing is a part of that. Starting when they're young is best and most effective, but it's never too late to learn
								new tricks. Toilet training is the number one priority for any animal with whom you share your home, as is working on
								obedience training. Learning socialization skills will help your puppy or kitten bond with you and with other pets. Ask
								your vet or local animal shelter for recommendations for good trainers in your area or at-home training guides to read.
								A well-trained pet is a happy pet, and that translates to a happy pet parent.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Following Dog Park Rules</h2>
							<p>
								
								Taking your dog outside to play is one heck of a good time, and, being the social creatures they are, dogs love a good
								romp outdoors. If you decide to take your pup to a dog park, abide by the posted rules. Proper dog park etiquette, such
								as bringing your own toys and not bringing in food, keeps everyone safe, especially if a dog is aggressive or
								under-socialized. Bring along treats for afterward to reward your guy for his good behavior. Vets also recommend that
								you wait until your dog is at least four months old before bringing him to the dog park to ensure he's vaccinated before
								being exposed to other animals..</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Safe Playtime</h2>
							<p>
							It's no secret that dogs and cats love to play, and it's an effective relationship-building activity. Take stock of
							their toys. Are they safe? Be mindful of threadbare stuffed toys that pose choking hazards and hard, sharp edges that
							could cause injury. Throw away and replace playthings that are worn out. Making DIY cat toys and dog toys is a great,
							inexpensive way to bring even more fun to pet parenting!</p>
